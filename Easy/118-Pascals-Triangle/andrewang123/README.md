Patterns that I saw:
1. The total of the numbers added up per row is 2^n-1
i.e 
N = 1 Total = 1
N = 2 Total = 1 + 1 = 2
N = 3 Total = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4
N = 4 Total = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8 
so on and so forth
2. N is literally the number of items that are being printed out
N = 1 Display: 1 (only one)
N = 2 Display: 1 1 (Two numbers)
so on and so forth
