# Solution for 118-Pascals Triangle
Link to Original Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/description/

Things to consider: 
With the n being the number of rows, we know that the largest and most bottom row
will have n elements. 

i.e.
n = 4

1 <br>
1 1 <br>
1 2 1 <br>
1 3 3 1 <br>

We can see that the last row, has n (in this case 4) elements.

In addition, we know that the first and second row will always be 1 and 1 1.
